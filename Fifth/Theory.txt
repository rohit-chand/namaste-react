1. What is the difference between named export, default export and * as export 
 a. Named Export : Named is when we export a variable or function by adding the keyword export when we declare it, to import it inside other file, we have to write the name of that variable/function inside curly braces {}.
 b. Default Export : We can declare a function/variable to be exported as default and whenever we import anything from that file, we will get the default export only unless we use {} or *.
 c. * as Export : We can import * as from any file then we access all the variables and functions exported from that file using the alias we have give after as.
